This repo was created to help diagnose an issue.

Tensorflow python (tftest.ipynb) was used to create a simple ML model.

The results are good and I wish to replicate those in tfjs.

When I export the Python model and import into tfjs, the results are the same.

However when I create a brand new tfjs model and train it on the exact same data, the results are completely different.

Example python and js code is included here in this repo, along with a single set of training, label, and input data files used to make predictions.

Using a single set of files across both python and JS eliminates the possibility that the training data is somehow different.

My expectation is that when creating a brand new tf model with the same topology as the python model, 
and train it on the same data, that the results would be very close.

Thanks for reading this and providing any suggestions!
